                                                            <p>In the GST Regime, businesses whose turnover exceeds Rs. 40 lakhs* (Rs 10 lakhs for NE and hill states) is required to register as a normal taxable person. This process of registration is called GST registration.

                                                                For certain businesses, registration under GST is mandatory. If the organization carries on business without registering under GST, it will be an offence under GST and heavy penalties will apply.
                                                                
                                                                GST registration usually takes between 2-6 working days. We’ll help you to register for GST in 3 easy steps.
